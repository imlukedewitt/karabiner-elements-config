# Karabiner Elements Configuration

Config for KE, based on several misc templates I've found online

- caps lock for hyper key (shift + cmd + opt + ctr) with other keys
- caps lock for Esc when pressed alone
- right/left shift to go forward/back a word when pressed alone
- press both shifts to toggle caps lock
- hyper + hjkl for vim motion
- hyper + {key} for app switching (switch to app if running)
  - a: Firefox
  - f: Chrome
  - s: Slack
  - c: VSCode
  - r: Terminal
  - w: Spotify
  - and so on
